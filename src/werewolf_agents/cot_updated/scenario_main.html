Hello players, night has started. Please go to sleep.
moderator: Day start:

Hello players, Good Morning. Please wake up.

Villager dead: Alas! A villager player has been eliminated by the wolves. His name is 'Haruto'.

Let me ask one by one about who are the wolves among ourselves.
moderator: Hey Helga, who do you think is or is not a 'wolf' in the group and what is your reason?
Alice: I think Bob is acting suspicious.
Fred: text="[From - Fred| To - Everyone| Group Message in play-arena]: I vote to eliminate Helga, as she was asked by the moderator to share her thoughts but hasn't responded yet, which could be a sign of evasiveness or an attempt to avoid drawing attention to herself, and I think it's reasonable to be cautious of players who are being quiet or unresponsive, especially given the early stage of the game."
moderator: It's time to vote. Who do you think is the werewolf?
Fred: text="[From - Fred| To - Everyone| Group Message in play-arena]: I'm going to stick with my initial vote to eliminate Helga, citing her lack of response to the moderator's question as a sign of evasiveness or an attempt to avoid drawing attention to herself, and I believe it's reasonable to be cautious of players who are being quiet or unresponsive, especially given the early stage of the game."

Hello players, night has started. Please go to sleep.
moderator: Wolf night:

Hello wolves, I have created this new private group between wolves called "wolfs-group".

I will use this group to ask you to vote a player to eliminate every night.

Here are the alive villager players for this night: ['Chagent', 'Michael', 'Helga', 'Ling', 'Haruto', 'Jian']
WolfAlice: Who should we eliminate tonight?
Fred: text="I think we should eliminate Haruto tonight, as we've discussed, since they haven't been involved in any discussions and it might not raise immediate suspicion, and also let's make sure to coordinate our actions during the day phase and create some confusion among the villagers by making ambiguous comments or asking distracting questions."
